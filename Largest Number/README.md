1. Convert each number in the list to a string.
2. Sort the list of strings in a custom way: compare two strings a and b by concatenating them in two ways: a + b and b + a.
3. Then compare the concatenated strings and sort in descending order. This custom sorting ensures that the resulting number is the largest possible.
4. Join the sorted list of strings into a single string.
5. Return the resulting string.
