1.Read the input array of integers nums.

2.Initialize Sum: Initialize a variable total_distance to 0. This variable will hold the total sum of Hamming distances between all pairs of integers.

3.Calculate Hamming Distance: Iterate through each pair of integers in the array nums.

4.For each pair (i, j), calculate the Hamming distance between nums[i] and nums[j].

5.Add this Hamming distance to total_distance.

6.After iterating through all pairs of integers, total_distance will contain the sum of Hamming distances between all pairs of integers in nums.

7.Return total_distance as the output.
