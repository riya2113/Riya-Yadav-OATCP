1. Sort the pairs array based on the end values (e) in ascending order. This ensures that pairs with smaller end values are placed before pairs with larger end values.

2. Initialize an empty array to store the valid arrangement of pairs.

3. Start iterating through the sorted pairs array from the end, considering the pairs with the smallest end values first.

4. For each pair, check if it satisfies the condition that the end value (e) of the current pair matches the start value (s) of the next pair in the sorted array. If it does, add this pair to the valid arrangement array.

5. Continue this process until all pairs are included in the valid arrangement array or until it's not possible to find a valid arrangement.

6. If all pairs are successfully included in the valid arrangement array, return this array as the result. Otherwise, return "No valid arrangement possible".
