1.Read the dimension of the grid, denoted as n.
2.Read the grid, representing each cell as either black (0) or white (1).
3.Initialize a variable, let's call it count, to store the count of subgrids with all corners black. Set count to 0 initially.
4.Iterate through each cell (i, j) in the grid, starting from the top-left corner.
5.For each cell (i, j), consider it as the top-left corner of a potential subgrid.
6.Iterate through all possible subgrid sizes starting from size 2x2 up to n x n (the size of the entire grid).
7.For each subgrid size, check if all four corners of the subgrid are black.
8.If all four corners are black, increment the count variable.
9.After iterating through all cells and subgrid sizes, count will hold the total number of subgrids with all corners black.
10.Output the value of count as the result.
