We're given two arrays, arr and brr, and we want to find the number of elements in both arrays such that the absolute difference between corresponding elements is at most 1. To solve this, we can follow a straightforward approach:

First, we sort both arrays arr and brr. Sorting allows us to easily compare elements in both arrays.

Then, we set up two pointers, i and j, initially pointing to the start of both arrays, and a counter variable count initialized to 0.

We iterate through both arrays simultaneously using the pointers i and j. At each step:

If the absolute difference between arr[i] and brr[j] is at most 1, we increment the count variable. Regardless of whether there's a match or not, we increment both pointers i and j. Once we've iterated through both arrays, count holds the number of elements that meet the criteria.

Finally, we output the value of count as the result, which represents the number of elements in both arrays with an absolute difference of at most 1.
