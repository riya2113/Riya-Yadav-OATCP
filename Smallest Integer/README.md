1. To store the number's digits, build a stack.
2. Iterate through each digit in the input number num.
3. Pop items from the stack and decrement 'k' for each digit encountered, provided that the stack is not empty, 'k' is larger than 0, and the current digit is less than the digit at the top of the stack
4. Push the current digit onto the stack.
5. After iterating through all digits, if k is still greater than 0, pop elements from the stack k times to remove remaining digits.
6. Construct the result string from the remaining digits in the stack. Ensure leading zeroes are not included.
7. Return the resulting string as the smallest possible integer after removing k digits.
